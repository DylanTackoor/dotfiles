What good is a dev setup if you can't replicate it? Don't you only really know something if you can explain the topic in simple terms?

Goals:

- Seperation of concerns: This script will contain everything, but is subdivided into groups: User, Dev, Dylan
- Reusable: Can be be run multiple times to reset system without breaking things
- Clarity: Documented meticulously to:
    1. Keep things clear for myself
    2. Keep things clear for you to learn from
